XPOKEREVAL 1.0

A collection of poker hand evaluation source code compiled by James Devlin.
Individual evaluators were written by many different people; see ABOUT.TXT
in each evaluator's folder for author information.

STRUCTURE

Each evaluator has been placed into a separate Visual Studio 2005 project.
Currently these projects are set to output static library (.lib) files, but
this can be toggled to produce DLLs instead, if desired.

For each evaluator, a sample project (suffixed with ".Test") is provided 
showing basic use of the evaluator.

NON-VISUAL STUDIO SOURCES

The XPokerEval distribution includes Java and other source codes which
aren't intended for a Visual Studio 2008 environment. For example, the
full Pokersource Java API has been included. You can find this source
code at XPokerEval/XPokerEval.Pokersource/java.

LICENSE

All of the source code included with this solution is open, meaning it's either
GPL, in the public domain, etc. Where pertinent, license information has been
appended to ABOUT.TXT for each individual evaluator.
