    For the evaluation functions that take a hand, you can pass it in two different ways.
    In either case, at least the first two cards must be present (your hole cards).

    The first option would be to pass the hand as a string. Valid formats include "Ah Kh 9d 8s Th",
    "AhKh9d8sTh", "AhKh    9d8sTh", etc... This would mean that the player holds Ah Kh while the board
    contains 9d 8s Th.

    The second option to pass cards is as an array of exactly 7 integers. Each integer represents a card as
    0-12 2h-Ah, 13-25 2d-Ad, 26-38 2c-Ac, 39-51 2s-As, any other number means no card
    The hand in the above example would look like: int hand[7] = {12, 11, 20, 45, 8, -1, -1};
    Hands passed by integer will process slightly faster than hands passed by string (although both are very fast).
    This way of passing hands is most useful for preforming enumeration outside of PSim.



    Version History:

	March 2008 version 1.3
    Fixed bug in GetHandState() not counting outs correctly for already strong hands.
    Added IsStraightPossible and IsStraightDrawPossible to PostFlopState.
    Added the hand state stuff into the java interface. I do believe it's complete now.

    February 2008 version 1.2
    Fixed bug in SimulateHandMulti() allowing opponents to share crads. (typical error of ~ 3%)
    Removed the simulate draw function. Simulate hand already does 94%, 90%, and the current %.
	Now including compiled DLL again.
	Now including AutoIt example.

    February 2008 version 1.1
    Add int[] hand interfaces to all functions.
    Made the java stuff into a package (PSim).

    February 2008 version 1.0
    First public release
