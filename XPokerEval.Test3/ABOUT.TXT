DESCRIPTION:

   A hodgepodge of evaluator-testing code written by Steve Brecher, in a famous
   2+2 thread:
   
   http://archives1.twoplustwo.com/showflat.php?Cat=0&Number=8513906&page=0&fpart=13&vc=1.
   
   This code tests 3 evaluators side by side:
   
      - The Two Plus Two 7-card evaluator
      - The Pokersource Poker-eval evaluator
      - Steve Brecher's HandEval evaluator
      
   In the following two scenarios:
   
      - Deal out and evaluate 1 million random hands
      - Enumerate and evaluate all possible 7-card hands
      
   In order to control which evaluator is used, you'll need to set one of the following
   three preprocessor macros (in TestHandRank.cpp) to 1:
   
      - LOOKUP
      - EVALN
      - HANDEVAL
   
   In order to control which test is run, you'll need to set one of the following two
   preprocessor macros (in TestHandRank.cpp) to 1:
   
      - RANDOM1M (million random hands)
      - ENUMERATE (enumerate all hands)
      
   Then rebuild and run.
