DESCRIPTION:

   The "Moritz Hammer" poker hand evaluator, which uses a Directed Acyclic
   Graph (DAG) in conjunction with the Cactus Kev poker equivalence classes
   to perform 7-card poker hand recognition.
   
   In order to use this evaluator, you will need the "eqcllist" and "handdag"
   files. The eqcllist file is included with the XPokerEval distribution.
   The handdag file can be acquired by either:
   
      - Building the file, using the accompanying Java code
      - Downloading the file from http://www.pst.ifi.lmu.de/~hammer/poker/handeval.html#source.
