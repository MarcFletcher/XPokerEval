DESCRIPTION:

   The XPokerEval.Pokersource project builds the "LIBPOKER.LIB" or "LIBPOKER.DLL"
   file from the Pokersource Poker-Eval source code (version 1.34.0). This is the
   same core LIB/DLL you would get if you built Pokersource via the makefiles.
   
   Note that this project is just one small piece of the Pokersource Poker-Eval
   code. The full Pokersource Poker-Eval distribution is contained inside this
   project's folder (that's XPokerEval/XPokerEval.Pokersource/), including various
   test utilities such as:
   
      - fish
      - hcmpn
      - hcmpn2
      
   You can open all this source code in a single Visual Studio solution, the file
   you want is POKER-EVAL.SLN.
   
   Also...
   
   The full source code for the Pokersource Java API can also be found in this folder
   at:
   
      /XPokerEval/XPokerEval.Pokersource/java
