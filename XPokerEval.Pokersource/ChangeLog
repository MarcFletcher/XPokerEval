	* include/poker_config.h.in, poker-eval/include/poker_defs.h,

         - configure tests for the existance of int64 and sets the HAVE_INT64 define
         - configure tests for the existance of long long and sets HAVE_LONG_LONG
         - in include/poker_defs.h, the definition of CardMasks only uses
           HAVE_INT64 to determine whether to use 64 bit integers or not,
           so 32 bit integers will be used even if long long is defined
         - also, if HAVE_INT64 _is_ defined (which is true if int64 was
           discovered to be a valid type by configure), it will then check if
           HAVE_LONG_LONG is defined and try to do a typedef of uint64 to long long.
         
         
         Further, it tests for <inttypes.h> and uses that in the tests, but
         never includes it in the source, even if it exists and was the reason
         why other tests in configure succeeded.  Finally, on all of the
         machines I have access to (SGI Origin, a multiprocessor IBM Power 5
         machine, 32 bit and 64 bit Linux PCs, and some miscellaneous Sun
         boxen) <inttypes.h> defines int64_t, not int64.
         
         There is also a small problem where the initialisation of the static
         tables will fail if HAVE_INT64 is defined, because the CardMask union
         will only define the single 64 bit integer, and the initialisers are
         all pairs of 32 bit integers.
         
         I've include some patches below.  They check for a native int64,
         int64_t, and long long, and will define HAVE_INT64 if any of those are
         found, and create a typedef for uint64 if it was not native.  It also
         causes both the pair of 32 bit integers as well as the 64 bit integer
         to be in the CardMask union so the initialisation of the static
         CardMask tables still works correctly.  I'm also pretty sure the line
         numbers for the configure

Thu Dec 02 3:00:0200.04  Tim Showalter  <tjs@psaux.com>

	* Updated Mac builds; currently, things seem to build with only
	  one config setting (--with-mac-target=darwin).
	* Make it unnecessary to have '.' in one's path when building.
	* bootstrap now checks for 'libtoolize' in both places, not 'libtool'
	  (My Debian system has no 'libtool', but my Mac does, and it's
	  not actually related to GNU libtool.)
	* boostrap now moves configure.in aside to shut up all the programs
	  that worry about configure.in's presence.
	* Fink now detected; --with-fink will default to /sw, as the
	  help claimed it did.
	* Default Mac build type is now darwin, since we have no carbon build.

Thu Nov 25 12:27:09 2004  Loic Dachary  <loic@dachary.org>

	* include/{,inlines/}*.h: add or update copyright notice at the beginning of the file.
	  Add POKEREVAL_EXPORT markers to extern symbols, include pokereval_export.h when
	  doing so. Add multiple inclusion guards when missing.
	
	* include/enumerate.h: random is called rand if WIN32 is defined

	* include/pokereval_export.h: add file to cope with
	  POKEREVAL_EXPORT keyword made to enable the use of poker-eval as
	  a shared library on windows.

	* include/Makefile.am (nobase_pkginclude_HEADERS): pokereval_export.h

	* lib/mktable.c: %xLL is %xi64 if WIN32 is defined

Sun Nov 07 11:42:07 2004  Loic Dachary  <loic@dachary.org>

	* tests/run.in : tests from Makefile.in are now in a script. Accomodate for

	  licensing issues are solved.

	  is still the default for older configures

	* include/poker_config.h.in: obsoletes include/config.h.in to avoid name conflicts
	  when distributing the headers. include/config.h is still being used for inclusions
	  within the poker-eval sources but is not published.

	* bootstrap: script to re-generate autotools files

	* poker-eval.pc.in: add pkg-config declaration file

	* AUTHORS: add missing list of authors
